        <p>Our coming-of-age has come and gone<br>
            <span class="sad">Suddenly this summer, it's clear</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>I never had the courage of my convictions<br>
            <span class="sad">As long as danger is near</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>And it's just around the corner, darlin'<br>
            <span class="longing">'Cause it lives in me, no, I could never give you peace</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
            <span class="peaceful">If your cascade ocean wave blues come</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>All these people think love's for show<br>
            <span class="peaceful">But I would die for you in secret</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me<br>
            <span class="curious">Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>Your integrity makes me seem small<br>
            <span class="sad">You paint dreamscapes on the wall</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor<br>
            <span class="longing">And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>Sit with you in the trenches<br>
            <span class="peaceful">Give you my wild, give you a child</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other<br>
            <span class="peaceful">Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>Is it enough?<br>
            <span class="curious">But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best<br>
            <span class="peaceful">But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
            <span class="peaceful">If your cascade ocean wave blues come</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>All these people think love's for show<br>
            <span class="peaceful">But I would die for you in secret</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me<br>
            <span class="curious">Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?</span><br>
